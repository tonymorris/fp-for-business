Functional Programming for Business
-----------------------------------

Functional Programming (FP) has been around since at least 1930s with the
milestone Church-Rosser Theorem. Subsequent advances include LISP
(McCarthy 1960) and landmark publications such as, Why Functional Programming
Matters (Hughes, 1990) and The Essence of Functional Programming (Wadler, 1992).

The idea then appeared forgotten until making a recent emergence in industry, as
businesses learn about a correlation between technical excellence and business
outcomes. Today, companies of all sizes are exploiting the practical advantages
of Functional Programming to achieve their goals and gain a competitive
advantage.

This talk will define Functional Programming, introduce some of the terminology
that is used and importantly, how FP is being used to achieve business
objectives.
