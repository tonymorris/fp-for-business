Functional Programming for Business
-----------------------------------

Functional Programming (FP) has been around since at least 1936 with the
milestone Church-Rosser Theorem. Subsequent advances include LISP
(McCarthy 1960) and landmark publications such as, Why Functional Programming
Matters (Hughes, 1990) and The Essence of Functional Programming (Wadler, 1992).

Functional Programming then appeared forgotten, until making a recent emergence
in industry and technological advances. Businesses of all sizes are exploiting
the practical advantages to efficiently achieve their goals.

This talk will provide a definition of Functional Programming, an introduction
to some of the terminology that is used and importantly, how the ideas behind
FP are being used to achieve business objectives.
