Functional Programming for Business
-----------------------------------

Functional Programming (FP) has been around since at least 1930s with the
milestone Church-Rosser Theorem. Subsequent advances include LISP
(McCarthy 1960) and landmark publications such as, Why Functional Programming
Matters (Hughes, 1990) and The Essence of Functional Programming (Wadler, 1992).

The idea then appeared forgotten until making a recent emergence in industry, as
businesses learn about a correlation between technical excellence and business
outcomes. Today, companies of all sizes are exploiting the practical advantages
of Functional Programming to efficiently achieve their goals and obtain a
significant advantage on their competitors.

This talk will provide a definition of Functional Programming, an introduction
to some of the terminology that is used and importantly, how the ideas behind
FP are being used to achieve business objectives. It is aimed at an audience 
looking to acquire a vocabulary of the technical concepts of FP, so that they
can be effectively applied in practice.
