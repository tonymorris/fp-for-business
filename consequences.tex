\begin{block}{Reasoning}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> since our program expressions are \emph{referentially transparent}, we may reason about each program part independently of all the others.
\item<2-> this idea is called \emph{equational reasoning}.
\item<3-> equational reasoning gives to the ability to comprehend our programs; small or large.
